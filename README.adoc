= Movies Hypermedia Demo

This is the source code for my conference sessions about using several Hypermedia representations
like HAL Forms to create a rich REST API with a simple VueJS based frontend. Since the backend
uses hypermedia, the frontend can be implemented robust and does not need to know so much about the domain.

This is work in progress, please stay tuned.

== Getting Started

* Make sure Java JDK >= 8 is installed
* Open a terminal and invoke "./gradlew build bootrun" (just "gradlew" under Windows)
